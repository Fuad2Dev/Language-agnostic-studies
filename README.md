# Introduction
"Programming language agnostic" refers to a concept or approach in software development that is not tied to any specific programming language. It means that a particular principle, technique, or concept can be applied across various programming languages without being dependent on the syntax or features of a single language.

## Desingn Principles
Design principles provide high level guidelines to design better software applications. They do not provide implementation guidelines and are not bound to any programming language. The SOLID (SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP) principles are one of the most popular sets of design principles.

For example, the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) suggests that a class should have only one reason to change. This is a high-level statement which we can keep in mind while designing or creating classes for our application. SRP does not provide specific implementation steps but it's up to you how you implement SRP in your application.

## Design Patterns
Software design patterns, on the other hand, are reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They provide specific implementation guidelines for solving these problems. Design patterns focus on the object-oriented design level and provide solutions for structuring classes and objects and defining their interactions. They are formalized best practices that help developers solve common problems in software design.
